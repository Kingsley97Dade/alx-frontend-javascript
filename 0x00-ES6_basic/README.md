# ES6 Basics
ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard. ECMAScript is the specification upon which JavaScript is based. ES6 brought significant enhancements and new features to the JavaScript language, aiming to improve code readability, maintainability, and developer productivity. It was officially ratified by ECMA International in June 2015.
Key features introduced in ES6 include:
+ Block-Scoped Declarations:
The let and const keywords were introduced for declaring block-scoped variables. This helps in avoiding issues related to variable hoisting and enhances the predictability of variable scopes.
+ Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions, making the code more expressive. They also have a lexical `this` binding, which helps in avoiding common pitfalls related to the traditional function expression.
+ Default Parameters:
ES6 allows you to set default values for function parameters. This simplifies the process of handling optional parameters in functions.
+ Rest Parameter:
The rest parameter (...) allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. This simplifies working with functions that can take a variable number of parameters.
+ Destructuring Assignment:
Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way.
+ Template Literals:
Template literals provide a more readable and convenient syntax for creating strings, allowing the interpolation of variables directly within the string.
+ Classes:
ES6 introduced a class syntax for defining classes in JavaScript, providing a more familiar and concise way to work with object-oriented programming.
+ Modules:
Modules were introduced to allow better organization of code by enabling developers to split their code into smaller, reusable files.
+ Iterators and Generators:
ES6 introduced the concept of iterables and iterators, making it easier to work with collections. Generators provide a simpler way to create iterators.
+ Promises:
Promises offer a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, improving the readability of asynchronous code.
