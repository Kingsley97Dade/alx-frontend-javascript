# ES6 classes
ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduced a new syntax for defining classes in JavaScript. Before ES6, JavaScript primarily used prototype-based inheritance. ES6 classes provide a more familiar and syntactically cleaner way to create constructor functions and handle inheritance.
ES6 classes provide a more concise and intuitive syntax for working with object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript. They are a syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model, making it easier to write and understand class-based code.
Here are the key aspects of ES6 classes:
1. Class Declaration: In ES6, you can declare a class using the `class` keyword.
2. Constructor Method: The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing objects created with a class.
3. Class Methods: Methods can be added to a class, and instances of the class can call these methods.
4. Class Inheritance: You can use the `extends` keyword to create a subclass that inherits from a superclass.
5. Static Methods: Static methods are defined on the class itself, not on the instances. They are called on the class rather than on instances of the class.
6. Getter and Setter Methods: You can use getter and setter methods to control access to the properties of an object.
